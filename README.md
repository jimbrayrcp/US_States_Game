**The U.S. States Memory Game**  
* * *

This game is a fun memory and spelling exercise which will help anyone with desire to totally conquer a 50 states quiz to completely dominate their class and completely impress their teacher.
<br><br>
This game was a class project which I made to be far harder to write than it should have been. However, the program worked as the instructor [Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer) requested as the end result will prove.
<br><br>
[This game is a python model of this original web based game read more about that project here.](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states)
_NOTE: Some basic python skills may also be aquired if you choose to try out this program._

## Directions:
> After starting the main.py file, <br>
> simply enter the **_correctly spelled_** state name into the text input box<br>
> the stat's name will appear on the map if it has been spelled correctly <br>
> and the word you entered is in fact a real state.<br><br>
> Once you have entered all the states you can remember a csv file will be<br>
> created with the names of the states you missed. The file will be opened with
> your default csv file application. You can save this file to any location you choose.
